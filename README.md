# Currency-Pair-Analysis-Anomaly-Detection
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the EUR/USD currency pair using a blend of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. It aims to forecast currency prices and detect anomalies in financial data. By applying models like Linear Regression and Random Forest for price forecasting, alongside Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, the project offers a solid method to understand currency trends and identify any irregularities that could signal risks or opportunities.

# Key Components:  
• Data preprocessing and feature engineering of financial data.  
• Supervised models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) for forecasting EUR/USD currency prices.  
• Unsupervised model (Isolation Forest) to detect anomalies in historical currency data.  
• Evaluation of model performance using various accuracy metrics and anomaly thresholds.  

# Technologies Used:    
**Languages**: Python  
**Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
**Tools**: Google Colab, Git Hub, Financial data APIs (for acquiring currency data)  

# Benefits:  
This project boosts financial data analysis by delivering reliable currency price forecasts while detecting anomalies. It improves prediction accuracy using both supervised and unsupervised learning methods and identifies rare or unusual patterns in the data. Such insights help traders and financial analysts make better-informed decisions and mitigate the risk of losses caused by unexpected market changes. The combination of different models ensures a comprehensive solution for both forecasting and anomaly detection in currency markets.
